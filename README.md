# Optimal medical plan for diabetes

On average, patients with diagnosed diabetes have medical expenditure 2.6 higher than those without diabetes.
Many diabetes patients cannot afford their medications.

This project aims to create an online tool for diabetes management that allows the prescriber to optimize the medication therapy for a diabetes patient, with various medical insurance and under different health condition (i.e. pregnant), by choosing the cheapest and the most effective options.
